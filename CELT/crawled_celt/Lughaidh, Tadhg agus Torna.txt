Lughaidh Tadhg agus Torna:
Flaithrí Ó Maoil Chonaire Lughaidh Tadhg agus Torna Dublin Royal Irish Academy Stowe M S E Prefatory Note In this quatrain Flaithrí Ó Maoil Chonaire pronounces a shrewd verdict on Iomarbháigh na bh Fileadh described elsewhere as 'magna sed inutilis controversia'
The Contention of the Bards had its origin in an attack made by the Clare poet Tadhg mac Dáire Mac Bruaideadha early in the seventeenth century on a poem which he and his contemporaries assumed to have been written by Torna Éigeas foster-father of Niall of the Nine Hostages
In response to this challenge Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh defended Torna and claimed that the northern half of Ireland was entitled historically to pre-eminence over the south
Eugene O'Curry expresses the view that the Contention sought to 'rouse and keep alive the national feeling and family pride of such of the native nobility and gentry as still continued to hold any station or fortune in the country'
The term 'easair' in line can be translated to mean 'dish' literally 'litter; any strewn covering for a floor'
In his catalogue entry for the variant reading in Egerton b Standish Hayes O'Grady states that it is more accurately translated 'the empty kennel;e
when the pups of both are stolen'
